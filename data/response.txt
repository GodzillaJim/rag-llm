Question: What is RAG in AI?

Context: orld. For example, Cyc failed to understand a story
about a person named Fred shaving in the morning (
). Its inference
engine detected an inconsistency in the story: it knew that people do not have
electrical parts, but because Fred was holding an electric razor, it believed the
entity “FredWhileShaving” contained electrical parts. It therefore asked whether
Fred was still a person while he was shaving.

The diﬃculties faced by systems relying on hard-coded knowledge suggest
that ge and acquiring knowledge can be done via learning,
which has motivated the development of large-scale deep architectures. However,
there are diﬀerent kinds of knowledge. Some knowledge can be implicit, sub-
conscious, and diﬃcult to verbalize—such as how to walk, or how a dog looks
diﬀerent from a cat. Other knowledge can be explicit, declarative, and relatively
straightforward to put into words—every day commonsense knowledge, like “a cat
is a kind of animal,” or very speciﬁc facts that you n ves
multiple quadratic ﬁlters for each neuron (
). Indeed our
cartoon picture of “simple cells” and “complex cells” might create a non-
existent distinction; simple cells and complex cells might both be the same
kind of cell but with their “parameters” enabling a continuum of behaviors
ranging from what we call “simple” to what we call “complex.”

It is also worth mentioning that neuroscience has told us relatively little
about how to train convolutional networks. Model stru e not yet learned to
ﬂy, sick or injured birds that have lost the ability to ﬂy, ﬂightless species of birds
including the cassowary, ostrich and kiwi. . . ” is expensive to develop, maintain and
communicate, and after all of this eﬀort is still very brittle and prone to failure.

While it should be clear that we need a means of representing and reasoning
about uncertainty, it is not immediately obvious that probability theory can provide
all of the tools we want for artiﬁcial intelligence applic  as legendary inventors, and
Galatea, Talos, and Pandora may all be regarded as artiﬁcial life (

When programmable computers were ﬁrst conceived, people wondered whether
such machines might become intelligent, over a hundred years before one was
). Today, artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is a thriving ﬁeld with
built (Lovelace 1842
many practical applications and active research topics. We look to intelligent
software to automate routine

programs.
